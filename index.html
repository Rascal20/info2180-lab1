		<p> I am currently a seeking a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of the West Indies Mona Campus.</p>
		<p> Not currently sure what route I'd like to take when it comes to specialising within my field of study but as of now I'm especially interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
		<p> I see Web Development as a form of artwork where someone can showcase their creativity and at the same time build or assist others.</p>
		<p>Coupled with the fact that web3.0 is probably right around the corner, I'd like to learn more about 2.0 so as to be able to appreiciate 3.0 when it becomes mainstream.</p>
